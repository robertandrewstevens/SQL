APPENDIX
Equivalent Constructs Among Databases
Relational databases support SQL in the same way that English is the language of the Great Britain, the United States, India, and Jamaica. Although there is much in common among the databases, each dialect has its own vocabulary and accents.
Throughout the book, the SQL examples have used Microsoft T-SQL as the dialect of choice. There are a number of things in SQL that varies from data- base to database. The purpose of the appendix is to show equivalent SQL con- structs in different databases. The five database engines are:
■■ IBM UDB, version 7 and above;
■■ Microsoft, version 2005;
■■ mysql, version 5 and above;
■■ Oracle version 9 and above; and
■■ SAS proc sql.
The databases from IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle are commercial products, although single-user versions can often be downloaded for no cost. mysql is a free database engine. SAS proc sql is the SQL engine within the SAS language (the most popular commercial statistical software). When using SAS, proc sql can be used in two different modes. In one, it communicates directly to a data- base, and supports the language of the database. In the other, it runs within SAS and uses SAS’s particular constructs.

￼￼This appendix is provided as is, without any guarantees that the software has not changed for whatever reason. The following documentation web sites are available for each of the databases:
■■ http://download-east.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/ b14200/toc.htm
■■ http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189826.aspx

■■ http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/index.html
■■ http://support.sas.com/onlinedoc/913/docMainpage.jsp
In some cases, additional navigation is required from the first documentation page, and for some sites, registration is required. Unfortunately, the ANSI standard for SQL is only available by purchasing it from the ISO organization.
This appendix is organized by the following topics:
■■ String Functions;
■■ Date/Time Functions;
■■ Mathematical Functions; and,
■■ Other Functions and Features.
Within each topic, specific functions are in subsections. Within each subsec- tion, the structure for each database is shown.
String Functions
This section includes functions that operate on string values.
Searching for Position of One String within Another
What is the function that searches for one string inside another string? The arguments are:
■■ <search string> — the string to be searched
■■ <pattern> — the string to look for
■■ <occurrence> — which occurrence
■■ <offset> — where to start searching
IBM
  LOCATE(<pattern>, <search string>, <offset>)

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Appendix ■ Equivalent Constructs Among Databases 613
￼￼The argument <offset> is optional and defaults to 1. The function returns the position in the search string where the pattern is found and 0 if the pattern is not found.
An alternative method:
  POSSTR(<search string>, <pattern>)
The function returns the position in the search string where the pattern is found and 0 if the pattern is not found.
Microsoft
  CHARINDEX(<pattern>, <search string>, <offset>)
The argument <offset> is optional and defaults to 1. The function returns the position in the search string where the pattern is found and 0 if the pattern is not found.
mysql
  INSTR(<search string>, <pattern>)
The function returns the position in the search string where the pattern is found and 0 if the pattern is not found.
An alternative method:
  LOCATE(<pattern>, <search string>, <offset>)
The argument <offset> is optional and defaults to 1. The function returns the position in the search string where the pattern is found and 0 if the pattern is not found.
Oracle
  INSTR(<search string>, <pattern>, <occurrence>)
The argument <occurrence> is optional and defaults to 1. The function returns the position in the search string where the pattern is found and 0 if the pattern is not found.
SAS proc sql
FIND(<search string>, <pattern >)
The function returns the position in <search

What is the function and operator that appends strings together?
IBM
         CONCAT(<string 1>, <string 2>)
Note that this function only takes two arguments, but the function can be nested. In addition, the operator “||” also concatenates strings.
Microsoft
         <string 1> + <string 2>
The concatenation operator is an overloaded “+” operator. When mixing char- acter and numeric types, be sure to cast the numeric types to strings.
mysql
         CONCAT(<string 1>, <string 2>, . . .)
Note: this function can take two or more arguments.
Oracle
         CONCAT(<string 1>, <string 2>)
Note that this function only takes two arguments, but the function can be nested. In addition, the operator “||” also concatenates strings.
SAS proc sql
         CAT(<string 1>, <string 2>, . . .)
Note: this function can take two or more arguments.
String Length Function
What is the function and operator that returns the length of a string?
IBM
         LENGTH(<string>)

  LEN(<string>)
mysql
  LENGTH(<string>)
Oracle
  LENGTH(<string>)
SAS proc sql
  LENGTH(<string>)
Note that this function ignores trailing blanks.
Substring Function
What is the function and operator that returns a substring?
IBM
SUBSTRING(<string>, <offset>, <len>)
The argument <len> is optional; when missing, the function returns the rest of
the string. The argument <offset> must be non-negative. Microsoft
  SUBSTRING (<string>, <offset>, <len>)
All arguments are required and the last two must be non-negative.
mysql
  substring(<string>, <offset>, <len>)
The argument <len> is optional; when missing, the function returns the rest of the string. If <offset> is negative, the function counts from the end of the string rather than the beginning.

         SUBSTR(<string>, <offset>, <len>)
The argument <len> is optional; when missing, the function returns the rest of the string. If <offset> is negative, the function counts from the end of the string rather than the beginning.
SAS proc sql
         SUBSTRN(<string>, <offset>, <len>)
The argument <len> is optional; when missing, the function returns the rest of the string. Note: SUBSTRN() is preferable to SUBSTR() because it does not produce errors or warnings when <offset>+<len> extends beyond the length of <string>.
Replace One Substring with Another
This function is the same across all databases, but differs in SAS.

How can a date be converted to the format YYYYMMDD?
