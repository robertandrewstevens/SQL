Teach Yourself SQL in 21 Days, Second EditionWeek 1 At A Glance Let's Get StartedWeek 1 introduces SQL from a historical and theoretical perspective. The first statement you learn about is the SELECT statement, which enables you to retrieve data from the database based on various user-specified options. Also during Week 1 you study SQL functions, query joins, and SQL subqueries (a query within a query). Many examples help you understand these important topics. These examples use Oracle7, Sybase SQL Server, Microsoft Access, and Microsoft Query and highlight some of the similarities and differences among the products. The content of the examples should be useful and interesting to a broad group of readers.Â© Copyright, Macmillan Computer Publishing. All rights reserved.
